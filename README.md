# Galaxy Code Challenge

The application is built using Django Rest Framework in order to create an endpoint to create and get users from a DB.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:RogerVR1994/galaxy-back.git

cd galaxy-back

# Create Virtual Environment
python -m venv venv

# Run Virutal Environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Install Python Modules
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run server
python manage.py runserver
```

This will create an application on port 8000, that will work as an endpoint to retrieve and create participants.
